# stackblitz-react-modal-dialog

[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/Sailwayfun/stackblitz-react-modal-dialog)

### How it works
- Create a modal with HTML <dialog> element and the createPortal method provided by react-dom.
- Use useRef hook to manipulate the dialog with DOM methods, dialog.showModal(), and dialog.close().
